Prettymapr: Tools for rapid, nice-looking maps in R
================

Prettymapr automates the process of creating a scale bar and north arrow
in any package that uses base graphics to plot in R, or provides
parameters that help to draw scale bars and north arrows in other
plotting environments. Bounding box tools help find and manipulate
extents, and geocoding tools help plot locations on maps. Finally, there
is a function to automate the process of setting margins, plotting the
map, scale bar, and north arrow, and resetting graphic parameters upon
completion.

## Installation

The prettymapr package is available on CRAN, and can be installed using
`install.packages("prettymapr")`.

## Future deprecation

The prettymapr package was written several years ago and better tools to
make publication-quality maps in R have been made available since its
release. The prettymapr package should be considered deprecated and is
in bugfix-only mode for the foreseeable future.
