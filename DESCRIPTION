Description: Automates the process of creating a scale bar and north arrow in
    any package that uses base graphics to plot in R. Bounding box tools help find
    and manipulate extents. Finally, there is a function to automate the process
    of setting margins, plotting the map, scale bar, and north arrow, and resetting
    graphic parameters upon completion.
